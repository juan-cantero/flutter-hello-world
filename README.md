# Flutter Bootcamp - Hello World Counter App

This repository serves as a **Flutter learning reference** and documents my journey through Flutter development fundamentals. It's designed to be a comprehensive guide for future reference when revisiting Flutter concepts.

## 📚 Purpose

This project is part of my Flutter bootcamp learning journey. It contains practical implementations of core Flutter concepts with detailed comments and explanations. The goal is to create a reference repository that I can return to when I need to refresh my knowledge or understand specific Flutter patterns.

## 🧠 Flutter Knowledge Practiced

### 1. **Widget System & Architecture**
- **StatefulWidget**: Learned how to create widgets that maintain mutable state
- **StatelessWidget**: Implemented widgets that don't change over time
- **Widget Tree**: Understanding how Flutter builds UI through widget composition
- **Build Method**: How Flutter renders widgets and when rebuilds occur

### 2. **State Management**
- **setState()**: Core method for updating widget state and triggering rebuilds
- **State Variables**: Managing mutable data within widget state
- **State Lifecycle**: Understanding when state is created, updated, and disposed

### 3. **Material Design Components**
- **Scaffold**: Basic app structure with appBar, body, and floatingActionButton
- **AppBar**: Navigation bar with title, leading, and action buttons
- **FloatingActionButton**: Circular action buttons for primary actions
- **Text Widget**: Displaying text with custom styling
- **IconButton**: Clickable icons with onPressed callbacks
- **Column & Row**: Layout widgets for arranging children vertically/horizontally

### 4. **Event Handling & Callbacks**
- **onPressed**: Handling button tap events
- **VoidCallback**: Function types for event handlers
- **Arrow Functions**: Concise function syntax for simple callbacks
- **setState Callbacks**: Updating state in response to user interactions

### 5. **Custom Widget Creation**
- **Reusable Components**: Created CustomButton widget for code reusability
- **Widget Properties**: Using final fields and required parameters
- **Constructor Patterns**: Proper widget initialization with super.key
- **Widget Composition**: Building complex UI from simple widget pieces

### 6. **Dart Language Features**
- **String Interpolation**: Using `$variable` syntax in strings
- **Conditional Expressions**: Ternary operator for conditional rendering
- **Arrow Functions**: Concise function expressions
- **Named Parameters**: Using required and optional named parameters
- **Nullable Types**: Understanding nullable callback types (VoidCallback?)

### 7. **UI Styling & Design**
- **TextStyle**: Customizing font size, weight, and appearance
- **MainAxisAlignment**: Controlling widget alignment in columns
- **SizedBox**: Adding spacing between widgets
- **StadiumBorder**: Creating rounded button shapes
- **Material Icons**: Using Flutter's built-in icon library

### 8. **Project Structure**
- **lib/presentation/screens**: Organizing screen widgets
- **Import System**: Using package imports for Flutter materials
- **File Organization**: Keeping related code together in logical files

## 🚀 Features Implemented

### Counter App Functionality
- **Increment Counter**: Tap + button to increase count
- **Decrement Counter**: Tap - button to decrease count  
- **Reset Counter**: Tap refresh icon to reset to zero
- **Smart Text Display**: Shows "Click" vs "Clicks" based on count value
- **Visual Feedback**: Large counter display with modern styling

### Technical Implementation
- **State Management**: Counter value persists during app session
- **Custom Components**: Reusable button widget for consistency
- **Event Handling**: Multiple button interactions with different behaviors
- **UI Structure**: Professional app layout with proper spacing and alignment

## 📱 Screen Structure

```
CounterFunctionScreen (StatefulWidget)
├── Scaffold
│   ├── AppBar
│   │   ├── Title (centered)
│   │   ├── Leading Icon (decorative)
│   │   └── Actions (reset button)
│   ├── Body (centered content)
│   │   └── Column
│   │       ├── Counter Display (large text)
│   │       └── Click/Clicks Label
│   └── FloatingActionButton
│       └── Column
│           ├── CustomButton (+)
│           ├── SizedBox (spacing)
│           └── CustomButton (-)
```

## 🔧 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
